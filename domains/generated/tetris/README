## TETRIS DOMAIN GENERATOR.

Usage: generator.py <grid_size> <number of 1x1 blocks> <number of 2x1 blocks> <number of L-shaped blocks> <lines-to-free>

All the parameters have to be specified. 

As for the grid_size, the number of column is fixed at 4. E.g., 8-> 8x4 grid. Only odd numbers accepted.

<number of 1x1 blocks> <number of 2x1 blocks> <number of L-shaped blocks> indicate, repspectively, the number of square, 2x1 straight and L (3 squares) pieces that will be placed in the grid. 

<lines-to-free> indicates the number of top rows that must be cleared for achieving the goal. 

** Take care, the generator does not perform any check on the fact that there is enough space for all the blocks! ** 


In the deterministic track of IPC 2014, grid size ranges between 10x4 and 14x4. Goal was to clear top half of the grid.

Number of blocks has usually been kept quite low --i.e. not enough for covering exactly half of the grid: otherwise planners were not able to solve.
